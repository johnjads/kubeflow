NLP Pipeline using Kubeflow
Author: Johnson

Project Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end NLP pipeline implemented using Kubeflow to demonstrate MLOps best practices. The pipeline preprocesses text data, trains a multi-class classification model, and deploys it to a managed endpoint. Kubeflow enables automation, scalability, and traceability throughout the machine learning lifecycle.

Problem Statement
Developing and deploying machine learning (ML) systems involves challenges like managing data pipelines, tracking experiments, ensuring reproducibility, and automating deployment. For NLP tasks, these challenges amplify due to data variability, preprocessing complexity, and real-time serving needs. This project addresses these challenges by:

Preprocessing raw text data into a structured format for ML ingestion.
Training an NLP model using Google AutoML for multi-class classification.
Deploying the model for serving predictions with scalable infrastructure.


Assumptions
The pipeline is designed for multi-class text classification tasks.
Google Cloud AutoML is used for model training and deployment.
Input data is structured as CSV files with text and label columns.
Kubeflow pipelines handle orchestration for preprocessing, training, and deployment.
The required resources (e.g., GCP credentials) are pre-configured.


Components and Workflow Structure
1. Preprocessing Stage
Script: utils/preprocessing.py
Prepares raw text data into a CSV file format required by Google AutoML.
Output: CSV file with text and label columns.
2. Dataset Creation Stage
Script: create_dataset.py
Creates an AutoML NLP dataset in the specified GCP project and region.
3. Model Training Stage
Script: train_model.py
Trains a model using the AutoML dataset for text classification.
4. Model Deployment Stage
Script: deploy_model.py
Deploys the trained model to a managed endpoint for prediction serving.
5. Orchestration
YAML File: nlp_pipeline.yaml
Defines the Kubeflow pipeline for automating the above stages.
Tracks and manages artifacts, logs, and metrics.


How Kubeflow Orchestrates MLOps?
Pipeline Automation: Automates data preprocessing, model training, and deployment stages using reusable components.
Experiment Tracking: Provides a UI to track parameters, logs, and results for each pipeline run.
Scalability: Enables distributed execution for resource-intensive tasks like training.
Reproducibility: Ensures consistent environments across pipeline runs with Docker containers.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Manages deployed models and provides monitoring for inference workloads.

My thought Process 
Modularity: Each pipeline stage is modular and reusable across different projects.
Scalability: Kubeflow enables horizontal scaling for preprocessing and training tasks.
Reproducibility: Ensures reproducible experiments using containerized components and version-controlled pipelines.
Traceability: Logs and artifacts for every stage are stored and visualized in Kubeflow.
Automation: Reduces manual intervention, enabling a continuous ML workflow.
